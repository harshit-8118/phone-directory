# phone-directory

## Project Based Learning -
- This was my academic project based on DATA STRUCTURE..
- I had used 'TRIE' data structure with 'AVL tree' data structure.
- The purpose of this project is to maintain phone directory with low space complexity.
- I had coded it down in C++.

### Working is as follow - 
```
a. select an option 's' - search, 'i' - insert, 'd '- delete, 'x'- exit from directory.
b. If one inserts name if name doesn't already exists it will be saved with number in phone directory.
c. If one search for name and it exists in phone directory, their contact details will be shown.
d. If one deletes a contact, it will be removed from phone records and can not be found on next search onwards.
e. Can exit from this looping operation under phone directory, by pressing 'x'
```
